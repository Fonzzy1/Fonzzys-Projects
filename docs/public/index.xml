      <description>Taylor Series A taylor series is an infinite series that estimates any continuous function as a polynomial. Taylor Series defined at point x=a as :
\[ \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} = \frac{\mathbb F^{n}(a)}{n!}\cdot(x - a)^n \]
luckily, this sytem can be further defined to:
\[\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} = \frac{ C(n)}{n!}\cdot(x - a)^n \]
with C(n) being defined as the function tht gives the value of \(\mathbb F^{n}(a)\) for each n. this definition is beneficial as computationally, it is difficult to define the derivative function, unlike a simple numeric funtion.</description>

      <description>This is a place that I use to show off the projects that I work on. There&amp;rsquo;s going to be a lot of weird thing&amp;rsquo;s that come out of problems that I come up with in my every day life, and the solutions are fun optimisation issues that are sometimes pretty cool.
If you ever want to talk to me my email is alfiechadwick@hotmail.com or shoot me a message on linkedin.</description>
